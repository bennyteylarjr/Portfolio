## Data Science Portfolio
### Benjamin Teye-Lartey | Data Scientist
This repository showcases my data science projects, encompassing academic work, self-learning endeavors, and personal interests. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that demonstrate my capabilities in various areas of data science, including:

* **Data wrangling and cleaning**
* **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**
* **Machine learning modeling**
* **Model Evaluation**
* **Model Deploymnet**
* **Data visualization**

I've used a variety of programming languages and tools throughout these projects, including:

* Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)
* R (tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, randomForest etc.)
* SQL
* Power BI
* Spreadsheet
* CSS
* HTML

**Feel free to explore the following:**

* **Project folders:** Each project has its own dedicated folder containing the code, data (if anonymized and publically shareable), and any relevant documentation.
* **Jupyter notebooks or R Markdown files:** Many projects utilize these interactive notebooks for clear explanations and code execution.
